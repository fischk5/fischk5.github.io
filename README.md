Putting my work on the map.  This project is a work in progress.

<strong>A New Beginning</strong>

This website was built to highlight my foray into the world of development.  They say never make big decisions for one year after a personal tragedy.  Despite this sound advice, I quit my job as a civil engineer, moved three cities east and enrolled in <i>Kevin Fischer University</i> to seek a new career in front-end web development.

<strong>The Building Blocks</strong>

The most formal of my education as a future web developer came through <strong>Udacity</strong>.  Their programs and courses offer breadth and depth for many topics, specifically front-end web development.

With a hobby-level knowledge of Java and Python, picking up the Big Three (HTML, CSS, Javascript) was a relatively fast process.  And by, "picked up", I mean I have been to the deep parts of StackOverflow for techniques and code snippets.  Ever evolving, my drive to learn the material indepenently is beneficial in the ever-changing world of code.

<strong>The Project</strong>

I decided the best way to pursue a new job in front-end web development is to... design a website!  My goal is to showcase my current level of design experience with the layout of the site, highlight a few projects I've been part of, and include the other typical items in a resume.

<strong>If you are a prospective employer, please be warned I am a highly motivated and hard worker!</strong>
